Quickie
===================================================

Why?
----

Sometimes you just need the ability to start writing a quick php script that needs database access.
I was absolutely sick of re-writing db connection code before even starting what usually is a proof of concept or 'throw-away' script.
So, through the power of composer and the wonderful doctrine/dbal package you can be in and out in super-fast time with:

	git clone https://github.com/mattkirwan/quickie.git

	cd quickie

	composer install

At this point it would probably wise to remove the .git directory, initialise your own repo for your amazing script and commit your .lock file.

...and i'm spent.
