Quickie
===================================================

Why?
----

Sometimes you just need the ability to start writing a quick php script that needs database access.
I was absolutely sick of re-writing db connection code before even starting what usually is a proof of concept or 'throw-away' script.
So, through the power of composer and the wonderful doctrine/dbal package you can be in and out in super-fast time with:

	git clone https://github.com/mattkirwan/quickie.git

	cd quickie
